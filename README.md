# LondonRentalMarket

Initially used Pandas to create a dataset comprised of London Borough statistics including:

  1. Average rental price
  2. Average salary of residents
  3. Crimes/1000 population
  4. Average GCSEScore
  5. Dwellings/ha
  6. House Prices
  7. % Social Housing

Using sklearn, to model and predict the rent price of a Borough using the other variables. Visualising the process with Plotly.
  - This can be viewed in the Jupyter Notebook file MLRentalMarket-code.

Displaying this visually in a Dash app. This was deployed through Heroku using:
  - The python code in app.py,
  - The procfile
  - The requirements.txt
